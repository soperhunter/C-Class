# C++ Class
This repository is a log of all of my practice coding assignments from my summer 2021 c++ coding class. This weeks upload consists of a programs that imports data from a text file, and uses that information to calculate a few different statements from a user input. The code asks for the user to input a weight of cheese, and the program calculates how many containers are necessary to hold said cheese, how much it costs to produce, and how much profit is made.
