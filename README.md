# C++ Class
This repository is a log of all of my practice coding assignments from my summer 2021 c++ coding class. This weeks upload (BowlingArrays.cpp) is a modified version of an assignment from last week that uses structures and arrays to store and calculate the bowling scores/averages of a bowling league. It has functions to get the information from a specified file and store it into said arrays, and it has functions to take that data and calculate the averages. Finally it has a function to print all the information into a readable format.
