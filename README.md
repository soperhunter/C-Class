# C++ Class
This repository is a log of all of my practice coding assignments from my summer 2021 c++ coding class. This weeks upload (Source.cpp) is made to make and display purchases made at a surf shop. There are functions to make purchases, display purchases, and display the costs of said purchases. There is also a function to display more information on the program.
